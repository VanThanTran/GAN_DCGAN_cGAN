Many activation functions will work fine with this basic GAN architecture. However, leaky ReLUs are very popular because they help the gradients flow easier through the architecture.\n\nA regular ReLU function works by truncating negative values to 0. This has the effect of blocking the gradients to flow through the network. Instead of the function being zero, leaky ReLUs allow a small negative value to pass through. That is, the function computes the greatest value between the features and a small factor.\nLeaky ReLUs represent an attempt to solve the dying ReLU problem. This situation occurs when the neurons get stuck in a state in which ReLU units always output 0s for all inputs. For these cases, the gradients are completely shut to flow back through the network.\n\n> *This is especially important for GANs since the only way the generator has to learn is by receiving the gradients from the discriminator.*\n\nFinally, the discriminator needs to output probabilities.
